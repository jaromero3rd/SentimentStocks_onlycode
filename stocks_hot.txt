|1615040002.0	 BB 	3047	I've never seen a stock react so poorly to good news like BB does|
---	(I keep doubling down more on BB and hoping that someday someway the good news and BB‚Äôs share price have a positive correlation) 
---	(Ever heard of Palantir?) 
---	(I think we need to see some improvement in BlackBerry‚Äôs financials before the stock can gain some serious traction.

Their gross profit and cash flows are currently trending the wrong direction, along with a considerable amount of growing liabilities compared to assets. 

BB definitely has potential, but for many investors, good news doesn‚Äôt out weigh poor financials. 

If the financials begin to turn around, I‚Äôm sure the stock will start to move in the correct direction.) 
---	($AMD in the recent months but I‚Äôm still extremely bullish on it long term) 
---	(You know the saying "buy the rumor, sell the news"? In this case BB is already like 100% up in the last few months, so the current good news are already priced in.) 
---	(You see an article every day because this sub and others like to highlight them as part of their pump and dump. 

Companies are always winning awards. The criteria for winning awards isn't as robust as you're assuming. It's often "purchased a table at the awards ceremony".

Companies are also always winning contracts. That's why they're companies. Thousands of companies have partnerships with Amazon.) 
---	(people fforgetting it has been trading at $4-5 less than a year ago, and just $6-8 before the Meme stock pump.

$10 or so is not reacting poorly, it is just back to its old trendline.

Stop thinking price action starts when you buy in) 
---	(I think the general sentiment right now in the media is that anything that WSB buys/advertises is trash.

This is of course not true in general, but a lot of non-Reddit retail investors will not think that a meme-stock can be a solid long term investment.) 
---	(You should check out AMD) 
---	(I have been holding this stock for 3-4 years and I couldn‚Äôt agree more.  Good news seems to correlate with a substantial drop in stock price ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. The trouble with blackberry has been their inability to turn all of that news into solid revenue.  But they did just settle a lawsuit with Facebook so we‚Äôll see if that translates into anything.) 
---	(BB is up 40% YTD and 90% from November. No idea what you're complaining about.) 
---	(Maybe it'll start moving when the EPS isn't negative and PS ratio get better.  I mean the PS ratio is at 5.6.  How much more you want it to rise.

If you really believe it, their sales will increase, the EPS will get better.  Then the stock will surely go up anyway.) 
---	(Strange. I read this exact post last week, but this one is only an hour old. Why are you reposting the same question?) 
---	(Sitting here with BB stock avg 14.47. Keep thinking I should avg down when it hits 10 then it pops back up a bit.) 
---	(Make your calculations and come up with an expectation for the coming 5-10 years. At the current price I come to a ~17% IRR over the next decade, hinging on them actually generating some strong earnings and free cashflows in 2021/2022.
It's a high risk since they don't have that yet today, and it's easy for unforeseen factors to pop up. But still worth a shot, just don't be impatient.) 
---	(I think 

A)the whole market shat itself since the middle of Feb. I don't think it's a crash, but it's a correction and atm everything is red, apart from a few speculative stocks. BB will probably head up once the correction is done

B)BB got caught up in the whole GME/AMC/BB debacle. It's worth more than $10, but it didn't go up to $25 because it's worth that (yet). Again, it will probably head up but not organically, due to value until the speculation is done.) 
---	(Because 99% of those articles are just puff pieces that have no material effect on the company. Who gives a fuck about some random award lol) 
---	(Lol, if you like the company then buy and hold. Just because it doesn‚Äôt move within a week of you buying doesnt mean it‚Äôs time to move onto the next stock. People are too obsessed with the quick return nowadays) 
---	(Ever heard of Nokia?) 
---	(Some of this price action is correlated with manipulation, some with price action of the overall market, and some related to the fact that many investors are waiting for BB to have better revenues in quarterly reports. All of these factors are likely to change at some point, but also, a single award or recognition or business deal is unlikely to reverse all of these current factors, at least for now. Things will change, just be patient) 
---	(Might have something to do with the whole market on fire as well.  BB is a long hold.  Check back in 2 to 5 years.) 
---	(Haha, good new doesn‚Äôt mean stock goes up, if it was that easy then everyone would be rich, there‚Äôs no guaranteed correlation) 
---	(Really? Have you not seen what has happened to $NVDA?) 
---	(Your welcome over to GSAT anyway friend! We have nothing but good news and huge losses üëç) 
---	(> What's it going to take for this thing to start moving? 

BB to start making money off of these deals. They aren't exactly raking in the dough just yet. BB is a long-term hold.) 
---	(I think the biggest thing that would help BB is a name change) 
---	(Be greedy when others are fearful. Be fearful when others are greedy.) 
---	(Oh no...I think Nokia has the lead on this. üòÇ) 
---	(remember the oil tanker boats from last year?) 
---	(Almost 100 percent of the time, any other person who isn't informed on their business now will only reference the shitty phone. I don't think they'll be able to shake that off. First impressions and all that.) 
---	(Honestly bb stressed me out too much, sold at a loss and moved on.) 
---	(Ever heard of Pfizer stock. Yes the COVID Vaccine company. It dropped 4$ after the Vaccine approval news. WTF!!) 
---	(Lmao who else bought them at $18 a share?) 
---	(I'm happy I got out of BB a while back after poking it with a stick everyday waiting for a reaction for weeks. it's drop yesterday to below 9 must have been painful for some.) 
---	(You obviously haven't been aboard the RKTship then. It's been trading flat for months goes down on great earnings, goes down when market goes up, goes down when market is down. It's been such a disappointment. This last week has been it's only saving grace.) 
---	(People are just looking for every tiny argument and news to justify a price target even if it‚Äôs completely irrelevant.) 
---	(Apple used to be like that before the iPod took off) 
---	(I think investors are nervous cause it was labelled a meme stock) 
---	(Dude the whole market dumped past 2 weeks stop acting like your stock is the only one affected) 
---	(Because meme stocks prices are currently based on fundamentals?  You‚Äôre thinking about this all wrong.) 
---	(Let me introduce u to palantir) 
---	(The stock is already up 100% over the past year.) 
---	(*‚ÄúIf a business does well, the stock eventually follows.‚Äù - Warren Buffett*

This is the quote I have been basing some of my long term plays like BB on that I genuinely believe are undervalued. I will continue averaging down because I believe that this is a $100+ stock at some point over the next several years) 
---	(Yeah, this is awful DD that‚Äôs not how you pick stocks) 
---	(I firmly believe that BB and NOK will one day reach their true value. Not sure how long it will take but that's my hope when I keep buying them) 
---	(BB was pumped as a meme stock so its still higher than it was earlier in the year.) 
---	(How heavy are your bags?) 
---	(Palantir and Black Berry are sexy twins that turn red the moment you compliment their stock) 
---	(BB is trading at 35x tangible book value.  No matter how many times I say it, and no matter how many times this sub doesn't want to come to grips with reality, hugely overpriced stocks have far more downward pressure than upward.  So when market conditions become volatile, these stocks trading at many times book or many times the industry earnings multiple come back down in very hard swings.

Speculative trading for unusually high returns carries tremendous risk precisely because it's predicated on irrational volatility, that is, stock prices deviating farther and farther from their actual operating value.  But it cuts both ways: If irrational volatility is what you want, irrational volatility is *exactly* what you're going to get.) 
---	(BB has done a remarkable job of reinventing itself, and it plays in market spaces (like the pubic sector) which are investing heavily in the types of software they produce.

The potential for growth is significant. But profitability is the only real proof.

The BB can show profit and get by the perception that they are old and creaky, the company will eventually do fine.) 
---	(They don‚Äôt make any money what is so hard to understand) 
---	(And that‚Äôs why my BB put is printing. 4,200% so far) 
---	(Let me introduce you to Microvast... Good news? Lets dip.) 
---	(I am like you, I am not a financial advisor, I am still very new to investing but take it more seriously than getting in on GME and calling myself a trader, but I will say, If you honestly believe in a company like you seem to believe in BB, don't be afraid to go LONG on them. There are plenty of good finds out there, especially woth the recent pullback.) 
---	(IVY gets me hella excited. How does the in-app experience evolve in a car? A train? A plane? A cruise ship? Space? 
I've been invested since the announcement, watched my investment increase 200% and I rode er back down to 7% where we are today. My booty-hole is already raw, the day to day swings don't bother me. Future looks promising for BB, I'll be continuing to add to my position as I can.) 
---	(Have they converted yet to subscription based pricing and is it generating a good revenue stream. They have tech that software engineers at Tesla can build if they wanted to. But, ok, sometimes it‚Äôs easier to ‚Äúbuy‚Äù rather than ‚Äúbuild‚Äù. How does a subscription for these things work on a car? Like, ok, I get XM, but you‚Äôre going to charge me so that my cars sensors work? Seems idiotic to pass that on to the customer in a subscription manner vs the all-in pricing that is paid now. Cars can easily last 10 years, so is the manufacturer picking up the subscription costs for that period of time? Wouldn‚Äôt they rather just book the earnings and cost? 

The data is likely worth a lot, but if it‚Äôs valuable, why wouldn‚Äôt the Tesla‚Äôs of the world just do it themselves. 

Either way, all these ‚Äúgreat things‚Äù will move the stock when they result in ‚Äúmaking money‚Äù. 

BB also has the stigma of being BB. They had the mobile phone industry in the palm of their hands and completely blew it. I know it‚Äôs not the same management and it‚Äôs been over a decade but stigma is stigma.) 
---	(I bought in at 17 and I think the only way for me to make a ROI is to do a covered call for it in 2023.) 
---	(the era of palantir could rival this stock) 
---	(Sold my shares of BB at a loss to buy more GME. Can‚Äôt get a W when u haven‚Äôt taken an L) 
---	(You should be just happy that you still got time to buy more while its at 10.00 per share.

I bought into blackberry in 2018 when they announced shifting focus to building softwares. Most of you guys only jumped in after the amazon news.) 
---	(Shhhh don‚Äôt tell people this! BB is so undervalued right now and I keep buying more and more.) 
---	(IMO it's two things:

1. It already moved quite a bit in the last couple months, probably "ahead of schedule"
2. They're fighting against the archetype that they're no longer a growth company, so they are not getting valued on speculation. I *think* it is going to require some earnings beats /  a firm trend established on some of these products before we see their effect

I am long BB) 
---	(it's only a matter of time till they blow up. Watch a random day this summer where BB grows 200% inexplicably.) 
---	(If you believe in the company like I do, hold. Its time will come. Personally, I think it‚Äôs a few years out from making and holding huge gains.
  
I have a certain amount invested for a long term lot and I‚Äôve been swing trading separate shares here and there, occasionally reinvesting some of the profits for additional shares to hold long.) 
---	(Buy low sell high. Now is the buy low part) 
---	(I made a lot of money off of Apple about 15 years ago but could have made way more if I was patient.

The issue was that it went up a lot, but flatlined for a long time, despite phenomenal numbers. I knew that big money was pushing it down, but lost my patience and got out.

Hindsight is 20/20, but my sight back then was great my patience however was NOT!

I would be retired today if I left my money in. If you truly believe in the stock, then I would just keep buying more on the way down.) 
---	(The memestock stink is keeping smarter investors away from it for starters. Also like the other guy said it's up 100% from months ago. If you truly believe in BB and think it is going to be huge in the future, you should be thrilled at this opportunity to pick up more shares.) 
---	(APPL had great numbers and dropped. NOK made money and went nowhere. PINS made a profit, grew revenue and tanked. I may sell PUT options on them to see if I can recoup. May just ride the storm out. Good companies bounce back) 
---	(Let me get this straight, you can't figure out why a company with no products anyone wants is not doing well?) 
---	(Space isn't stupid, guy..) 
---	(It's probably because no one understands that BB is no longer a phone company but a tech security company. Additionally it's probably not well known that their software exists in a ton of cars. It's super important especially given that many car companies are gunning for automated driving.
It's a long winded way of saying perhaps marketing hasn't done a good job making these points clear. My strategy is keep buying at discounts as the people who are selling are most likely still stuck in the mindset that BB is a phone company.
Not financial advice of course.) 
---	(*SENS has entered the chat*) 
---	(Down like 24 percent since I bought into BB. Good thing I'm in for the long run which I now define as several million years.) 
---	(Love these daily BB bag holder posts.

QNX isnt some magic industry changing first. They make a couple bucks of each car sold and Ford already dumped them.

Do you even know what the Amazon contract is? How the fuck does that bring in revenue?) 
---	(BB isn't as great a stock as reddit keeps making it out to be.) 
---	(It is often said they buy the rumor, and sell the news.) 
---	(Name checks out üëç

Also, BB is a long play. Got grouped in with memestocks as a quick win but that‚Äôs never been what it was.

If you got in in Jan you may have got in a little high but give it a year or so and $15-20 will look like $65-$100.) 
---	(It has been this way for a long time with this company.  They bring it a new phone that was great but they would get slammed and less and less people bought them.  They had bbm which was revolutionary at the time and it just got past by others. 

The way to make money on blackberry has been to buy the stock and sell covered calls when the price goes up.) 
---	(Maybe, you don't know $AMD. Only good news for over a year, competition faltering, analysts posting very high PTs, very nice profits and earnings, but sideways for months and fell 25% on this shit sell-off that nothing has to do with AMD.) 
---	(It is news. When all that was said in the news becomes revenue and the company‚Äôs bottom line starts getting bigger, it is then the stock will climb back up. That‚Äôs my thought. Bag holding 765 @ 18.50CAD.) 
---	(Amarin would like a word. Posts best quarter ever, impending European approval of biggest product‚Äîdrops 28% in a week.) 
---	(Ever heard of NOKIA ??) 
---	(*Baidu.) 
---	(Elementary my dear Watson. With a shift in the markets due to anticipation of the economy reopening, after a year of being shutdown. Investors have moved the lions share of their money into bonds, as a safe haven that at least is on an upward trajectory, while readjusting investments into growth, and commodity stocks, that will be replacing the tech stocks, as the preferred investments for the coming year, as they will be the beneficiaries, of a recovering economy. Start thinking about investing in anything that involves people not being at home.) 
---	(We Canadians don't like going up.

Whenever I google bb.to, there is also a couple of sites saying give up on bb.to....) 
---	(You serious? Have you seen Pltr? Announces partnership with Amazon and boom! $21 üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ) 
---	(Same is being happening with QCOM :() 
---	(BB has historically been a hated stock.  Pick an entry point and sell a put $1 - $2 lower than that entry point.  Easy money.) 
---	(One of the things that has been happening to me personally is that the brokerage firm I‚Äôm dealing with has banned buying stocks from many stocks that are currently ‚Äúunder investigation‚Äù it‚Äôs insane and it‚Äôs illegal. But there is nothing to do because many trading companies are following suit and they‚Äôre getting away with it. So that might be one of the problems with buying power. 

I actually closed a couple of positions yesterday because my margin rate is so low it‚Äôs getting bad but I still have faith in BB) 
---	(I made the mistake of buying during the hype at $18. I looked at it hit $26 and thought here we go. Only to see it crumble. Like you said, I bought it with all the good news and potential. Yet it‚Äôs just going further down. Depending how my other stocks do in several weeks, if I can make enough, I might just sell BB at a loss. Unless I pretend I don‚Äôt own it and just let it sit for as long as I‚Äôm able to mentally handle it.) 
---	(I'm all in on gme then transferring to BB when it's done. I'm surprised every time I see it's down) 
---	(I had 255 shares and was able to average myself from over $20+ per share down to 11.40. It made the one pop last week and continued to crash all this week. I finally sold all of it out of frustration. üñï$BB) 
---	(Hello, Nvidia would like to speak to you.) 
---	(One thing I learned about Canadian stocks is that the Americans love to short them... why?

Becuase they are NOT American and they need to short something. Canadian stocks generally trade at about a 10% premium... why?

Because they are NOT American. 

You see it time and time again.) 
---	(Pepsi has had a net positive year, multiple deals set for future innovation, signed LeBron from coke to Pepsi, had a big dividend, and has been retracing lows and is FINALLY coming back up. I'm expecting a big move off its 128 support from here on out. 

It's held nice during this sell off atleast and Im now positive but it took way too long imo.) 
---	(I actually think that they, along with nokia, are actively trying to keep their stock prices around the same level. Just a gut feeling.) 
---	(The stock is overvalued. It‚Äôs trying to come down, what you are seeing isnt a bad reaction to good news, it‚Äôs good news slowing down the plummet. 


It‚Äôs a good company, it‚Äôs a growing company, but it‚Äôs not worth the gains it has seen in the last 6 months. 

There are a few stocks that maintain the viral growth and defy the urge to come back down to reality. BB looked like one that might do that, but it‚Äôs not. The vast majority of stocks will come back down to their value after a viral surge. 

How can you tell when it will or it will unjustifiably just keep going up? Answer that and you can name your salary at any fund on the planet.) 
---	(I think they need to do more clear announcements with companies they work with. It‚Äôs really annoying because long term potential is crazy. Honestly to the public eye the name ‚ÄúBlackberry‚Äù is attached to a dead phone company. This is completely false) 
---	(DMTK dropped almost 10% after beating earnings estimates haha) 
---	(Lol BB was at 5$ beginning of November and is now at 10$ and it doesn't move) 
---	(That's because you don't hold $ATVK) 
---	(Nokia‚Äôs stock is the same. A few months ago there were like 5 positive bits of news and the stock price dropped $0.03 a share.) 
---	(NVDA. Beat earnings but now down about 100$)

---	(I sold 21 CCs with $25 strike for 2023. Might as well make some cash now)

---	(Love people that went full on on BB hoping that it'd be next reddit meme stock only for it to lose 25% in 3 weeks. If you like the company just hold the stock long term.)

---	(You must not be invested in ESGC, then. I shake my head every time I look at it.)

---	(BB's recent stability, more or less regardless of good news or market downturns, but solid long term prospects is why I bought more to sell covered calls on. The weekly premiums are juicy.) 
---	(You are suggesting the stock market will act rationally. 

Suggestion to make some cash: never expect that.) 
---	(Dont worry. BB is wsb favorite stock. It will have it turn when the GME and amc hype die down. Just hold wsb favorite stock and one day it will get pumped. Pltr, nio, nok, bb and so on.)

This name got a lot of attention during the GME run, and it may have some indications of a future revival but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not priced accurately.  It‚Äôs up a ton in the last year.)

It was a tough road to be on and still is if you are still on it.  Something that has proven true that I heard once, buy the rumors, sell the news. Thought it sounded crazy, but trust me, there is someone smarted than me that figured it out.) 
---	(Lololol ikr I've been buying so much and losing so much) 
---	(Maybe the news just isn‚Äôt as big as you think it is? People are out there digging up every single positive comment about BB to sell it to Redditors or rationalize their own stock purchases. How much of this stream of press releases actually affects their business? How does some random customer licensing QNX dramatically change the fortune of the company, when selling software licenses is a basic expectation of being in the software business?)

---	(It's honestly weird af. I've sarcastically responded to someone mentioning impending good news with "I bet it'll drop instead" (or something along those lines) and ended up being right. 

Do you think it's just because people still look at it as the old blackberry? I honestly dont get it. I've been following them for a while just waiting for bottom so I can buy in deep) 
---	(Maybe because the market is based on technicals and not fundamentals ü§Ø) 
---	(TELL recently paid off a bunch of debt, had some other great news, the next day it tanked lol.) 
---	(Same for NOK - I get their press releases via email a few times a week and they are always announcing a new partnership or a new 5G deal but lol the price goes down.) 
---	(If the company makes money, hold it with confidence and treat this as a sale and buy more if you can. If you‚Äôre a long term investors, you shouldn‚Äôt worry about noises like this. In the last 2 weeks, with market correction, no companies are shielded from drop even with good news. If you‚Äôre a short term trader, BB is probably not for you, there are other more hyped companies out there that you can trade off of volatilities.) 
---	(Good news makes stocks go down because people buy in anticipation.  When they news actually breaks, they take their profits.  

Edit:  that‚Äôs just a guess.  Add in some computer based trading in which upper limits are hit, triggers cash outs which then triggers more cash outs.)

|1615075970.0	 VFF 	7	Time to revisit VFF with OCS stats out and ER a week away|
---	(I put 30% of my weed portfolio into VFF, for all the reasons you pointed out.  They were growers before getting into weed, which gave them a huge step up. I really like this stock.) 
---	(I don‚Äôt hate it, just manage your expectations. Being a seller of wholesale flower, they‚Äôll forever have to be looking over their shoulder for competitors as the cannabis trade opens up in regions that might be better suited to ideal growing conditions. Plus, consumer preferences are slowly shifting away from flower to processed goods (edibles, etc), which is also where the better margins are found.

Agreed their outlook is better than most of the companies you listed as peers, particularly considering current valuations. The big prize in North America is the US though, and every day that passes the big MSOs are establishing distribution and relationship with dispensaries. Will cannabis be sold at Walmart one day? Maybe! But crystal ball is showing that to be unlikely in the next few years.) 
---	(Been bagging 4000 vff for 2.5 yrs now. My thesis back then was management canada rollout-distribution in canada 10% market-high margin product-usa rollout upon legalization-repeat. 

So far they managed until usa market, but management positioned itself well enough for that as well. These guys understands the produce business, not overproduce cannabis im the hype only to see sg/a skyrocket and place business in bad position. Holding out on d3 even with strong cash position via stock offering (tho i hate it) is a big sign of prudence. Expansion plan, with how they are posiitoned in texas i cant think better ways than how the management did for a cannabis grower. 

However i do have doubt on cannabis market as a whole. Vff is amazing company in the operation level but macro level, i just dont see cannabis valuation supporting 40-100x forward pe in most companies.

---	(i think the drop has less anything to do with him and more with the market) 
---	(That‚Äôs a lot of writing) 
---	(I'm an AMZN holder, and I believe Jassy will be a good CEO (maybe better than Bezos, since Jassy made the only profitable part of the company). One possibility to consider is that Bezos is leaving because he wants to work on other projects. For those projects, he'll need lots and lots of money. Where is his money? AMZN stock. So he might be selling his shares, thus depressing the price. Bill Gates did the same thing when he left MSFT, and ended up with fewer shares than Steve Ballmer. 

It's natural for AMZN to be horizontal for a while--it had an enormous run-up in 2020, then the news of Bezos leaving, and now a broad market sell-off due to treasury yield fears (which hurts growth companies like AMZN in particular). Personally, I think AMZN is amazingly undervalued right now.) 
---	(The drop in AMZN has nothing to do with the new CEO and everything to do with the overall dip in the markets, particularly tech stocks.) 
---	(You‚Äôre assuming a lot by thinking the decline is due to the CEO announcement.) 
---	(Worked at AWS for five years and sat in meetings with Jassy. Jeff wouldn‚Äôt of given him the company reigns if he wasn‚Äôt certain he could do it. Jassy is brilliant and can do the job, his style is a little different than Jeff‚Äôs but I don‚Äôt think outsiders know how pervasive Amazon culture is steeped in the company. There will be a steep learning curve and will take him a few years to learn the rest of the business but he will have Jeff looking over his shoulder. 

The recent dip has very little to do with the CEO change and more has to do with the macro environment. There is some belief that AMZN will dip as we reopen the economy. They‚Äôre also tied up in some of the high growth tech stock rotation.

Amazon is a tricky one to value. It is one of the few stocks I don‚Äôt like to use a PE for just because there isn‚Äôt a great historical value and it is a slow and steady come-down over decades. They also are unstable in how much they reinvest back into the company, basically if they see something to their liking they give zero fucks about pouring money into it.

I like price to free cash flow instead which tends to range from 40-80. Right now it is at 54 which isn‚Äôt terrible but isn‚Äôt a steal either. That said, the great thing about Amazon is it is growing so fast so if the price stays constant you‚Äôll be in the 40‚Äôs by the end of the year.

I would buy but would not be surprised with a 30% hit if it gets thrown out with the bath water if there is a QQQ crash. Long term this is a decade buy and hold stock. One of only three I subscribe that to: BAM, BRK, AMZN.) 
---	(basically I'm inexperienced and would like some pointers from a more experienced investor on how my thinking/ideology could be improved and also some clarification for confusion I have regarding $AAPL's lack of a dip when Tim Cook took over as CEO.) 
---	(If u have they much liquidity to flip amzn you don't need us) 
---	(It has nothing to do with this lol) 
---	(I own 100 amazon shares

And im never selling.

Look at bigger picture and Jassy is good ceo)

---	(The whole tech sector and especially growth stocks tanked lol. And the reason they tanked  is not at all caused by your 'EV' theory.

I can take a dump, make  a bullish/bearish view depending on which way it points , and have a 50/50 chance of being right. Doesn't mean I'm right. If you are so confident, why did you close your puts?

By the way, NIO does not outsource their manufacturing. It's NIO's team and equipment etc despite manufacturing plant being owned by JAC.

Anyway, good work for taking the profit and not being greedy.)

---	(Please keep selling NIO so I can keep buying the dip!)

Teslas market becomes increasingly crowded with big established names with good products and Tesla has a very small moat if any built in the EV space.

I feel like their whole evaluation is built on them succeeding in various fields like autonomous driving and disrupting the whole mobility market. Betting on them delivering on that and also dominating that space, seems quite far fetched to me.)

|1615032067.0	 BIO 	3	LANDOS BIO Unclaimed GOLD|
---	(Your position??) 
|1615020348.0	 QQQ 	4	Whats the difference between the QQQ and TQQQ|
---	(IF you can handle the volatility, it has returned long term as well

Its inception was Feb 9, 2010.  

TQQQ 10,219%

QQQ 698%

S&P 500 259%

Not many ETFs, mutual funds, or hedge funds can claim that record.

There are always individual stocks like TSLA that can (17,486%), but it is still pretty good for an index ETF.) 
---	(T) 
---	(Yes TQQQ is a leveraged ETF so it‚Äôs returns are multiplied by 3 but so are it‚Äôs losses making it pretty risky as the losses are harder to recover. Usually a short term vehicle from my understanding) 
---	(Do some googling. I read an interesting article on TQQQ that showed that around the 5-year mark is where things get dicey for TQQQ. The idea is that in that 5 year period the owner is likely to see a major correction that decimates their gains. 

So hold it, but not for too long.) 
---	(More risk. More volatility. Larger returns during bull runs. 

People on here love to say decay isn‚Äôt real and that if you hold for the long term you‚Äôre fine....that‚Äôs not true. Over the long term you won‚Äôt get 3x the return. And huge crashes wipe you out. 

TQQQ has only ever existed in a bull run. Multi year bear markets will kill any and all gains you had and set you back. 

I read an article a few weeks ago talking about if you had bought TQQQ back 1998 before the Dotcom bubble and held until 2018 (the article was written) you‚Äôd have a whopping 27% return over 20 years. Where as the QQQ would‚Äôve returned over 400% before reinvesting dividends. 

You can see the problem better with the S&P500 and $UPRO (3x leveraged s&p500) with the Covid crash. 

The S&P500 crashed 32%. UPRO crashed 75%. If you had bought VOO on 2/14/2020, you‚Äôd be up 13%. If you had bought UPRO on 2/14/2020, you‚Äôd be up 6%. 

The bigger the crash, the better you‚Äôd be avoiding leveraged ETFs. The general idea that I‚Äôve read behind leveraged ETFs and holding them is to hold them for about a year. This minimizes your risk of running into bear markets.)

|1614993555.0	$PYPL 	17	ARKK sold half of their $PYPL holdings|
---	(cathie has said during tough times, they sell off the ones theyre somewhat sure about to buy the ones theyre 100% sure about 

during covid crash, they halved their holdings to buy the dip on the stocks they loved) 
---	(I don‚Äôt know, but could it be it‚Äôs easier for them to sell those PayPal shares then other stocks they own. The larger company‚Äôs are more liquid and easier to move than say a smaller company they own stock in. 

Do you see PayPal going anywhere in the near future?) 
---	(It‚Äôs ARK selling secondary plays to buy their core holdings on the dips.) 
---	(Everybody is adjusting their positions right now. It would be interesting to know what they traded $PYPL for. Let us know) 
---	(They needed cash so they sold their lower conviction companies or just picked something with high liquidity as a lot of their smaller companies have such low liquidity it wouldn't make sense selling them.) 
---	(More reason to buy PayPal) 
---	(Ebay is now using there own collection for fees dropping paypal. But other digital collections are using paypal but loosing ebay profits is a tough one especially since there the same entity.)

---	(She sold Roku for days and now she just purchased a bunch back yesterday. Who knows her logic.....) 
---	(Portfolio management. You just see it because she‚Äôs complete transparent.) 
---	(Could be just profit taking. I sold a 3rd of my position between 265 and ATH. I bought in around 200 after the (asset that cannot be named on this forum) news. If it drops more, I'll try to buy more if I can, but raising cash right now is tough since it's all going to other growth stocks. And on top of that Grayscale was selling at such a huge discount, I couldn't say no and pumped a bunch more cash into it as well.)

|1615009272.0	$CRSR 	8	Why there won‚Äôt be a selloff when $CRSR lockup ends.|
---	(I think your vastly underestimating the selling pressure here. Companies IPO as an exit opp not because they want you to own shares.)

---	(It's not 24 hours.) 
---	(After hours and pre-opening trading is unregulated. The prices fluctuate a lot because it‚Äôs typically thinly traded and someone is usually in there trying to push the markets to open in a certain direction foe their own gain.) 
|1614986279.0	 XL 	7	Is Muddy Waters short report on XL Fleet legit or just another Citron hatchet job?|
---	(Nobody knows. Seems like the timing of it was perfect for getting the price down to the mass during this week. I‚Äôm holding with many, many shares. Seems like games are being played, I‚Äôm waiting for XL results) 
---	(I‚Äôm 120 K down with 13900 shares. This whole thing smells awfully fishy to me. I‚Äôve done a lot of DD on this company and believe in what they are doing. They‚Äôre currently trading at about 2x P/E ratio so I‚Äôm not worried.) 
---	(Taking a step back, jury rigging an electric drive train and a battery pack onto ICE trucks doesn‚Äôt feel like a business plan for a billion++ dollar business.

---	(Would love for it to get just a *little* more hyped though.  It's my biggest loss atm, missed the day when it shot to $28 like a damn fool.  Selling covered calls on it for now) 
---	(i bought 770 shares at 24.60 im not going anywhere) 
---	(Agreed. BB is a whole different game. I'm taking advantage of the NLOK dip too. Can't go wrong with cyber security.) 
---	(I bought BB earlier this year. Been close to selling at a loss. Might just as well hold on) 
---	(The more DD I do the more confirmation bias I get ü§î.

Very unique situation for a stock.) 
---	(Great time to get in before Q4 earnings at the end of this month

I think we BB is going to beat earning expectations AND have a huge boost with FB settlement. All of the BB 'good news' is dependent on earnings. Once earnings start to be reflective of good news, good news might actually bump up SP instead of BB following market trends for the day.) 
---	(I've been averaging down weekly, the dips are blessings in my eyes ü§ûüëå) 
---	(Bear thesis for BB:

Yes, they are a fundamentally solid company. No doubting that, but so is Palo Alto Networks, Netapp, and Oracle. But why aren't they trading at 30-40x revenues like Palantir, Cloudflare, or Twilio? Look at their growth. Its in the single digits. In the Bay Area literally only boomer parents work there as they solve pretty mundane problems. Same with BB. Slow growth, no reason for it to trade at 10x its revenue.) 
---	(I‚Äôm deeer in BB then I have been on any other stock. Ever) 
---	(I keep buying. I've got some June and January calls plus up to 700 shares now. 

I love and hate BB at this point.  

I feel like I'm getting to buy on sale but also anytime any good news is released it drops more.  I'm dreading earnings lol.)

Key insights -

1.	‚Å†‚Å†Drones confirmed by CTO (this is big news) as big application for QNX
2.	‚Å†‚Å†Body-language wise didn't seem like CTO was worried about semi-conductors
3.	‚Å†‚Å†Said that automotive slowed down b/c of covid but made reference to the fact that they were "coming out of it" - Feels bullish for next earnings or two
4.	‚Å†‚Å†Adhoc (messaging solution) straight up benefitted from COVID. zero hesitation from CTO answering that question. This is pretty bullish.) 
---	(Nah, they are a garbage company that have spun their wheels for 3 years. They seem allergic to organic growth.

Im willing to bet they drop after these earnings. They cant seem to put up good numbers for earnings for the last 2 years to save their life. I dont believe this quarter will show much difference. 

Guess this is what new bag holding looks like. The original BB bagholders from 2010 were probably thrilled to be able to exit this thing recently, based on the comments Ive read online.

Chen can suck my ass; he is somehow unable to market and sell a bunch of high quality products. Frustrating to watch.) 
---	(Bb hasnt been a thing in ten years. Do they have secret money somewhere? If theyre good as you say they should change branding. Blackberry will always be that phone company back then.)

Inflation concerns positively impact commodities/companies that produce commodities. Biden is restricting the creation of new leases, so existing American oil companies (like MRO) are incredibly well positioned to profit off an ever decreasing supply as old leases dry up. I seriously don‚Äôt think $80-$100 dollar oil is a meme.)

The other half of JAC is owned by the city of Hefei, who also bailed out Nio for a stake in the company last year. I expect Nio's previously announced deals with GAC and Changan - owned by other cities - are dead now as a result. Hefei wants NIO with their own JAC. 

Good for NIO that they have solid plans to enter the mass market and won't dilute the NIO brand doing so. Perhaps a little less good that they'll be doing so via a joint venture where JAC will get 51% of the profits.)

Is it a good time to buy AAPL? Well it‚Äôs pretty far off it‚Äôs ATH, so yes, I think so. Is it a good time to buy calls? No one knows. 

I‚Äôm buying shares with the idea that I can just hold if the correction continues or if we just trade sideways for a bit. With calls, youre on a much more strict time frame for recovery, which is anyone‚Äôs guess right now. 

If you wanted to play the options game right now, I would be selling puts, not buying calls. If you get assigned and have to buy 100 shares of Apple at $90 or whatever, it‚Äôs not the end of the world, its a great discount on a solid company, you can just hold from there. otherwise it‚Äôs free money.)

AAPL isn‚Äôt going anywhere. They‚Äôre immensely profitable, globally recognized, and they have an insane amount of cash to weather any storm.)

1.) There is pent up demand to travel and there will be more demand for oil from the economic recovery(+ the infrastructure bill).

It is a no-brainer that oil consumption will rise again dramatically as things become more normal, no matter how much governments talk (and maybe to a lesser degree walk) about green energy. These companies also pay good dividends. So, oil will not send your portfolio to the moon, but also not into the Mariana Trench.)

Apple is a solid company with probably the best balance sheets you‚Äôll find. It‚Äôs hard to go wrong if you are in it for the long term. 

That being said. Don‚Äôt expect to double your money each year. Apple will do well, and probably will beat the market, but it isnt going to double each year.)

It's basically where you put your money if you can't think of any better ideas.)

Nonetheless I will buy AAPL for sure. Both stock and products.) 
---	(Tech is going to have a sell off for some time. At least that‚Äôs why I think. All tech will recover and more so it never a bad time to buy, just know it will probably go down for a little longer)

if you think the price might drop, you can always DCA and buy in chunks rather than all at once. ultimately, even if it does dip some more, the odds are VERY good that it will be worth substantially more this time next year.) 
---	(Aapl is a good buy at 150+  
I purchased another $1k worth today.)

---	(It's slightly overvalued and we may see a real tech correction soon (but who knows). That being said it's apple. You can probably buy it every month and be justified in doing. I can't really think of a better single stock to just blindly invest in considering their cash reserves, dividend, growth, cult fanbase, leadership, etc.) 
---	(I picked up three shares this week but I'm holding off on buying more for a while. I just started investing recently so I want to see if I can snag more for a better price.) 
---	(Apple historically has never really been a bad buy. I‚Äôd say now or next week is probably about as good as it will get.)

---	(> With news of Mar 18 release of the 6700 XT and overall demand expected to remain high/consistent through the year, stock will continue to go up.

I like what AMD is doing, but right now they're having supply issues. These supply issues are AMDs biggest challenge in the short term. Releasing a new graphics cards isn't going to help with the supply issues. In fact, generally speaking premium products have the larger profit margins than economy products. If you consider that the 6700 card is the cheapest in the 6000 series, then it could hurt AMDs bottom line since it is competing for resources with AMDs higher end GPUs.

I'm not saying don't buy AMD, but I wouldn't use the 6700 as the reason to buy AMD.)

It would take a massive collapse for me to be in the red on the TSLA shares I have and even if that happens, I‚Äôve profited so much that I wouldn‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm playing with house money at this point.

It is a completely different situation with stocks that I have purchased recently, like in the last 3 months. My thesis for getting into these positions has not had the time to play out at all and I have some FUD about whether they will or not. I believe I made good calls on all these positions, but until they have the time to mature, it is hard to stop second guessing. 

Basically, it‚Äôs easy for an investor with substantial time in the market that has banked good profits to sit there and criticize. Being new to the market or even having new positions can be nerve wracking.) 
---	(I keep telling myself that the companies I have chosen to invest in are good buys. I still believe that the companies I have shares are good! It sucks seeing red over and over, of course. I actually find it easier though when I go and look at all the other companies like top 100 or whatever and see the exact same pattern on everything. Makes it easier knowing it isn't personal and everyone is in this shit filled boat. It will return, pandemic still hitting hard, and stimulus around the corner.

I learnt much about the market and my own risk tolerance level. Sometimes the loses early on are a gift !) 
---	(It sucks but so long as you‚Äôre in companies who don‚Äôt base their value off of sales in the next 5 years, I think people would be wiser simply holding through this.

I remember a post weeks ago calling new investors basically dumb for worrying about a couple red days when we finally hit a rare green day, but low and behold look where we are now haha.

People understand that Amazon is a great company.   They forget it sold around $100/share in 1999 and sold for $6/share in 2002, and now sells over $3000/share.   The people buying in 1999 were spot on right about the company but grossly wrong about the price.  In fact AMZN didn't again hit a $100/sh until 2010, so they lost money for 11 years if they were foolish enough to hold that long but 99% sold in the single digits or teens.)

Then we had the Mar 2020 crash, but today Tencent is at 693HKD even after the recent 2 weeks of red.

If you believe in the company, just hold or DCA.)

---	(I started in 2020 two weeks before the crash. The first thing I've experienced in investing is one of the hardest and fastest crashs in history. I wasn't really impressed by declining numbers, I just didn't know how to behave in a crash. If I hadn't hesitated I could have bought Tesla at the absolute bottom. 

Next time I know better. My cost averaging plan is still running with Tesla at its top. Their innovations are years ahead and I don't really care about the immediate numbers.

I guess years of gaming make me feel like this is just another game where you have to exploit the rules. Seeing red and buying more is part of that exploit.)

---	(I think the whole psychology of risk tolerance is super super interesting and definitely something that should be studied but this NIO situation is super interesting for me. I bought in March around 19 because I'm a car guy and I saw a top gear video on it, started researching their tech, hot-swappable batteries, growth etc. And it was a crazy ride but the way I looked at it was I bought this stock specifically because I believed in it and what the business was doing and unless something significantly changes about that I will stay in it.

I used to have 440 shares of NIO when it was at 2.5. I got scared and sold at 2.8.

Well, that didn't go well... I felt a deep pain over NIO for a couple of months. I wished the company would burn down.

Then I had the idea to buy 1k euros of NIO at 60. The reason was to see it burn down from a closer distance. And it has been so rewarding so far! Have already lost 300 euros. HMMMM I love it)

Personally, if I see 2 red days in a row or just a really bad day I don‚Äôt look for a week. Its a lot easier said than done, but it does help out a lot. I‚Äôm in very volatile stocks such as Nio but I live the company. To me it‚Äôs not just a stock, I genuinely have spent hundreds of hours looking into this company and I believe they will succeed.
